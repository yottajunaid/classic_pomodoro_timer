# Classic Pomodoro Timer with GUI

## Overview

This repository contains a simple yet effective Pomodoro timer with a graphical user interface (GUI). The Pomodoro technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It involves breaking your work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

This application is designed to help users implement the Pomodoro technique seamlessly, providing a visual timer with configurable work and break durations.

## Features
